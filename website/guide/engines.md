# Choosing an Engine

vitest-native ships **two engines behind one plugin**, so you choose the fidelity each suite needs. This is the core idea of the project — nothing else in the React Native testing space gives you the choice.

## The two engines

```ts
reactNative()                      // default — real React Native (native), when its babel deps are present
reactNative({ engine: 'native' })  // force real React Native; mock only the native boundary
reactNative({ engine: 'mock' })    // opt in to the fast pure-JS mock
reactNative({ engine: 'auto' })    // the default — native when available, else mock (with a one-line notice)
```

`reactNative()` with no options resolves to **native** whenever `@react-native/babel-preset` and `@babel/core` are present (i.e. any real RN app), falling back to `mock` only when they're absent.

## `engine: 'native'` — real React Native

Runs **real React Native** JavaScript — the same code that ships in your app — and mocks only the thin native boundary (the same modules Jest's preset mocks).

**Reach for it when you want:**

- **Fidelity** — accessibility behavior, RN-API semantics, and component internals that a mock can drift away from.
- **Integration confidence** — testing how your components actually compose with real RN.
- **No mock drift** — you're testing RN itself, not a reimplementation of it.

It Flow-strips real React Native through your project's Babel preset — the toolchain RN already uses — so it needs `@react-native/babel-preset` + `@babel/core` (present in every RN app).

## `engine: 'mock'` — fast pure-JS

A fast, zero-dependency pure-JS reimplementation of React Native. Mocks *all* of React Native.

**Reach for it when you want:**

- **Pure-logic suites** — testing reducers, hooks, and view logic where you don't need real RN.
- **Environment control** — full control over platform, dimensions, color scheme, and native modules.
- **Maximum determinism** — no real RN internals, no Babel, just Vite.

The mock engine covers [100% of React Native's stable public API](/api/coverage) and needs no Babel.

## Side by side

|  | `engine: 'native'` *(default)* | `engine: 'mock'` |
|---|---|---|
| What runs | **Real React Native** JS | Fast pure-JS reimplementation |
| Mocks | Only the native boundary | All of React Native |
| Fidelity | Highest | High, but a reimplementation |
| Babel | `@react-native/babel-preset` + `@babel/core` | None |
| Best for | Fidelity, integration, accessibility | Pure logic, environment control, determinism |
| Test API | RNTL, helpers, presets | RNTL, helpers, presets |

Both engines share the same test API. You can mix them across suites in the same project.

## Keeping the mock honest

Because the mock is a reimplementation, it could drift from real RN behavior. A **CI-gated behavioral cross-check** runs the same assertions against both the mock and real RN across React Native 0.81–0.84, so divergences are caught before release. See [Comparison with Jest](/guide/comparison#the-cross-check) for how that trust mechanism works.

## Hot runtime (experimental)

For large suites under the native engine, an opt-in **hot runtime** keeps React Native warm across files while resetting app/test modules and common process-wide pollution between files:

```ts
reactNative({ hotRuntime: true })
```

It uses Vitest's custom worker APIs and remains experimental. Leave it off unless you're testing it.
